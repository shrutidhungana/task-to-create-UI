           <p>Following are the position of some chef roles:</p>
           <dl>
               <dt>Purchasing Manager</dt>
               <dd>The purchasing manager is in charge of buying all of the food for the kitchen. This person keeps track of the food available in the kitchen and the food that needs to be ordered.</dd>
               <dt>Kitchen Porter</dt>
               <dd>The kitchen porter usually does not have the same training and experience as the chefs. This person is in charge of simple but important tasks involved in the basic preparations of the food. </dd>
               <dt>Commis Chef</dt>
               <dd>A junior chef, also called the commis chef, works with station chefs  to learn about the kitchen environment. This person has recently completed some schooling or training and is beginning to work in the culinary field.</dd>
               <dt>Chef de Partie</dt>
               <dd>The station chefs arguably have the critical roles in the kitchen. These chefs  cook the food that is being served to customers. However, there are multiple positions that fall under the station chef title. Each chef is responsible for a different “station,” with different chefs for each food category.</dd>
               <dt>Sous Chef</dt>
               <dd>The deputy chef, otherwise known as the sous chef, remains second-in-command in the kitchen. Depending on the restaurant and its management, it is possible to have more than one sous chef. </dd>
               <dt>Chef de Cuisine</dt>
               <dd>The head chef remains at the top of the hierarchy in restaurant kitchens without an executive chef. Like an executive chef, this person controls all aspects of the kitchen. </dd>
               <dt>Executive Chef</dt>
               <dd>Not every restaurant has an executive chef; that title normally applies only to large chains or restaurants. Generally, an executive chef does very little cooking. Their primary role is managing the kitchen and its staff. This includes overseeing and training personnel, planning menus, managing the culinary budget and sometimes purchasing. </dd>
